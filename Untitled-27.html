<p>Star Luo Empire is located in the south of Douluo Continent. Its capital, Star Luo Empire Imperial City, is one of the two largest cities in the entire continent. They also entrusted a large amount of territory and had countless nobles with armed forces. Unlike the Tiandou Empire, although there were several kingdoms in the country, the imperial power was not dispersed. This was due to the special competition method of the royal family: survival of the fittest.</p>
