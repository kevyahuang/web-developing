	<h2 align="center">Tang Sect</h2>
<p>Tang Sect, the most famous sect in Bashu. The location of Tang Sect is very mysterious. Many people only know that it is halfway up a mountain, and the top of the mountain where Tang Sect is located has a frightening name -  Ghost Seeing Sorrow. The reason why ghosts are worried is because if you throw a stone from the cliff of this mountain, it will take a full nineteen times to hear the echo of the stone falling to the bottom of the mountain. It is precisely because these nineteen seconds are still more than the eighteen levels of hell, hence the name.</p>
	<p>The Tang Sect has been divided into two sects, the inner and outer sects, since its establishment. The outer sect is composed of disciples with foreign surnames or those who have been given the Tang surname, Tang San is a member of the outer sect, while the inner sect is directly affiliated with the Tang Sect and is inherited by the family.
There are a total of seventeen elders in the Tang Sect's inner elders' hall, including the head, and there are exactly seventeen of them climbing the mountain at this time.</p>
<p>The Tang Sect is good at making hidden weapons and poisons, but they are famous throughout the Bashu Kingdom for their hidden weapons.
There are many kinds of hidden weapons in the Tang Sect, among the machine-type concealed weapons the three most famous ones are the plume, the Buddha's Furious Tang Lotus, and the Rainstorm Pear Flower Needle.</p>
