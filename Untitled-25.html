<h2 align="center">The Douluo Continent</h2>
	<h3>Three main parts on the continent:</h3>

<p>Douluo Continent is the main land in the world that Tang San traveled to. In the first season of this anime, there were two main empires on the Douluo Continent: the Tiandou Empire(<a href="Untitled-26.html">more about the empire</a>) and the Star Luo Empire(<a href="Untitled-27.html">more abou the empire</a>). At the junction of the two countries, a city called Wuhun City and a large primeval forest, the Star Dou Forest, are controlled by Wuhun Palace. The Wuhun Palace also has several branches of the Wuhun Palace(<a href="Untitled-28.html">more about the palace</a>) in the Tiandou Empire and the Star Luo Empire.
There is an island called Poseidon Island in the sea on the west side of the mainland. During this period, the three forces of Tiandou Empire, Star Luo Empire, and Wuhun Palace restricted each other. In the Battle of Jialing Pass, the Wuhun Empire lost to the Tiandou Empire and the Xingluo Empire led by Tang San, and the Wuhun Palace was eventually destroyed.</p>

<h4>The two main forests in the continent:</h4>
<p>The Star Dou Forest is a huge virgin forest. It is one of the three most famous soul beast settlements in the Douluo Continent. It is located directly south of the Tiandou Empire. Its terrain is complex, including wetlands, swamps, etc., and it falls within the tropical range. , most of the forests are dominated by tropical plants. The forest is located in the center of the continent, straddling the borders of the Tiandou Empire and the Star Luo Empire. It is the place where the border between the two countries is least clear. Among them, two-fifths of the area is located in the Tiandou Empire, and three-fifths is located in the Star Luo Empire. The closer you get to the center of the forest, the more powerful the spirit beasts areï¼Œthere are even soul beasts that are 100,000 years old. The two forest kings are the Azure Bull Python and the Titan Giant Ape.</p>

<p>The area of Sunset Forest is much smaller than that of Star Dou Forest, and it is located in the center of Tiandou Empire. Although there are many soul beasts in the Sunset Forest, not many can reach a cultivation level of more than ten thousand years. Most of them have a cultivation level between a thousand and ten thousand years. However, the fourth soul rings of the six of the Shrek Seven Devils are all related to it. The temperature of Sunset Forest is much lower than that of Star Dou Forest. The plants are mostly temperate plants that are unique to the north. The density is not high, and it is much easier to move around than in Star Dou Forest. </p>

<h4>The Eye of Ice and Fire:</h4>
    <p>At the center of the Sunset Forest is a hot spring called the Eye of Ice and Fire.The two eyes of ice and fire may not be able to form in one place for thousands of years. It is a unique spring eye. One eye is twinned, and the two eyes are mutually restrained. Half of the Bagua-style hot spring is filled with ultimate fire and half is filled with ultimate ice. There is a poisonous flower guarding the outside of this spring. In the first season of this anime, even if someone or a spirit beast enters the Ice and Fire Eye through poisonous flowers, they will explode because they cannot adapt to the environment here. There are only rare medicines and plants in the Eye of Ice and Fire, and the growth time of these rare plants in the Eye of Ice and Fire is shortened by ten times. The Eye of Ice and Fire was originally the secluded place of Poison Douluo Dugubo, but since Tang San, this place has been under the jurisdiction of the Tang Clan in the Douluo Continent and is the Tang Clan's main resource.</p>
